# apple-app-site-association.test

I find that AASA format changed.

The old one works in iOS12.4 and doesn't work in iOS15

My implementation uses the the new one in .well-known directory

Please visit https://apple-app-site-association-tes.herokuapp.com and use ios app to test

The live version uses expressJS implementation

You can validate using https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/
